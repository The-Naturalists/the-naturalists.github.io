          <p title="Welcome message">Welcome to the website of The Naturalists,
          the IISc undergraduate biology club. We are a small group of undergraduates,
          who are interested in biology and its different
          aspects and wish to explore the subject as much as we can. We aim to gain
          the most we can from the peer pool by arranging regular discussions among
          ourselves and presenting our views on different modern topics. Also,
          talks on different biological fields by professors will be arranged and
          we plan to go out occasionally on some trips.</p>
          <p>Please mail to us, <a href="mailto:naturalists.iisc@gmail.com">The Naturalists</a>,
          about any idea or topic you find interesting and worth discussing in the club!</p>

          <h2>13th November, 2015</h2>
            Discussion on 'Quorum Sensing'. Read up all you can and as much as you can. Do not restrict yourself to biology.
            To be held in Room G-20 or F-08A in Old Physics Building at 7.00 pm. Links to a couple of papers are given below.

            More would be uploaded, once everyone shares the papers they have read.

          <h2>6th November, 2015</h2>
            Talk by Kaivalya Molugu, 4th year undergraduate, titled, "Structural Understanding of Aryl
            Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR), a potential drug target for cancer therapy".
            To be held in Room G20 of the Old Phyisics Building (OPB) at 5.30 pm.
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a cytosolic transcription factor
            that mediates cellular responses to diverse environmental chemicals
            and endogenous metabolites. It has been shown to play an important
            role in toxicity response, and normal immune and cardiovascular functions,
            with important implication for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Increasing
            experimental data provides substantial support for an association between
            abnormal AHR function and cancer, implicating that AHR might be a potential
            drug-interfering target. Determining the structure of AHR may provide usefu
            insights into this potential. However, the structure of AHR has not yet been
            determined completely due to the various problems associated with its
            stability and solubility during the process of crystallization to
            determine its structure. In this talk, I will discuss about attempts
            made to tackle this problem.

          <h2>9th October, 2015</h2>
            Introductory session for the new members of The Naturalists has been organized.
            It is to be held in Room F-08A of the Old Physics Building (OPB) at 6.30 pm. All undergrads
            are welcome. Tentatively, what we plan to do is:
            <ul class="disc">
              <li>Introduce the new members to the club</li>
              <li>"Act of Life" (Dumb charades in a biological domain)</li>
              <li>"20 Questions"</li>
            </ul>
            Further ideas are welcome. Just send us a mail at
            <a href="mailto:naturalists.iisc@gmail.com">naturalists.iisc@gmail.com</a>.
